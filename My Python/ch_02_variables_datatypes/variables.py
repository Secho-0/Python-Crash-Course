# Avoid using Pythons Keywords or Function names:
#    sum, print, read, write, various other functions found in documentation. 
#         This is only best practices for now and will be covered when redefining them is appropriate later



# Keep names short, but descriptive
#
#                       n is bad | name is good
#                     s_n is bad | student_name is good 
# length_of_persons_name is  bad | name_length is good 

message_1 = "hello"
print("message_1 says: " + message_1)
# 1_message = "hello" is a bad variable because numbers cannot be the start of a variable. only Letters and underscores ( _ ) 

greeting_message = 3
print("Greeting Message says: " + greeting_message)
#greeting message = 3 is a bad variable (space between)
